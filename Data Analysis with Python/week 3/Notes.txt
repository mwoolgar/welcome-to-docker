Descriptive Statistics::

df.describe()

df.describe(all) - this includes the NaN values

value_counts() - summarize categorical data
e.g. 
drive_wheels = df['drive-wheels'].value_counts()

drive_wheels_counts.rename(columns={'drive-wheels':'value_counts' inplace=True)
drive_wheels_counts.index.name= 'drive-wheels'


Box plots::
Good for comparing groups.

sns.boxplot(x= "drive-wheels", y="price", data=df)

Median - Middle
Upper Quartile (75th percentile)
Lower Quartile (25th percentile)

Lower + Upper Quartile = Inter-Quartile Range

The lower and upper extremes. These are calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range above the 75th percentile and as 1.5 times the IQR below the 25th percentile.

Scatter Plots::

Good for comparing relationships between two variables
Predictor/independent variables on x-axis (engine size)
Target/dependent variables on y-axis (price)

uses Motplotlib

y=df('engine-size')
x=df('price')
plt.scatter(x,y)
